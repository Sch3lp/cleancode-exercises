This is a repository with exercises to [Uncle Bob's Clean Code book](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), a.k.a. _The Bible_.


## Chapter 9
First refactor the tests to look like Listing 9-5.

Then refactor to something you'd write yourself.

## Chapter 14
The code is like Uncle Bob left it according to his _Rough Draft_ (Listing 14-8).

You can follow his previous work (Listing 14-9 and 14-10) as separate commits.

You can now follow along with the book and do the refactorings just like Uncle Bob describes in his book.

There are some Unit Tests you can run, but they're not complete. So you might want to write your own before you start your refactoring.
